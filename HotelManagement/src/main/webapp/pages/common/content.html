                    <p data-elm-loc="1">Will the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration join regulators in other countries
                        and order a global grounding of the 737 Max 8, the Boeing Co. airliner involved in two similar
                        crashes in five months? The answer isn’t as clear-cut as some might think.</p>
                    <p data-elm-loc="2">While the agency issued a notice Monday to the Max 8’s 59 operators stating its
                        “continued&nbsp;airworthiness,”&nbsp;the decision on whether to stand by that call depends as
                        much on&nbsp;political judgment as any yes-or-no technical assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p data-elm-loc="3">Airlines and regulators in other countries are already voting with their feet.
                        China, Indonesia, and Singapore have suspended operations of 737 Max variants, while Ethiopian
                        Airlines Group, Grupo Aeromexico SAB de CV, and Brazil’s GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA have
                        grounded their own planes.&nbsp;As a result, about a third of the 350-strong global fleet is
                        already out of action.&nbsp;</p>
                    <wp-ad id="slug_inline_bb" class="wp-inline-bb pb-centered-bb" style="margin: auto;"
                           aria-hidden="true" data-slot="business"
                           data-json="{&quot;targeting&quot;:{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;inline_bb&quot;,&quot;ctr&quot;:[&quot;zeus_b&quot;,&quot;zeus_b_inline_bb&quot;]},&quot;categoryExclusions&quot;:[]}"
                           data-size="[[2,1],[300,250],&quot;fluid&quot;,[620,250]]" data-refresh="on"></wp-ad>
                    <p data-elm-loc="4">Although the FAA has the most important position as the home-country&nbsp;regulator
                        that certifies Boeing planes, decisions by other nations have a steamrolling effect that could
                        force its hand.</p>
                    <p data-elm-loc="5">In truth, no one can be 100 percent sure at present whether the striking
                        similarities between the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on Sunday and PT Lion Mentari
                        Airlines Flight 610 in October are merely an unfortunate coincidence, or the sign of a deeper
                        common problem.</p>
                    <p data-elm-loc="6">In that murk of uncertainty, Boeing and many of its airline customers&nbsp;will
                        want the regulator to wait for substantial&nbsp;evidence to emerge before taking the drastic
                        step of suspending flights. Passengers and air-crew unions, on the other hand, will want to be
                        sure that flights are safe, and seek a more precautionary approach. Balancing those two
                        priorities isn’t easy: If the FAA is&nbsp;perceived to have put lives at risk because it feared
                        acting too aggressively against Boeing, the damage to the reputation of both could be
                        devastating.</p>

                    <p data-elm-loc="8">There’s no technical trigger for a grounding order. Instead, it’s a judgment
                        call by the department in question, complicated by the fact that the FAA currently doesn’t have
                        a permanent administrator. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, who’s responsible for
                        the agency&nbsp;and whose views would probably be decisive, seems to be&nbsp;taking a
                        wait-and-see approach. Boeing’s Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg, meanwhile, has worked
                        hard to be close to President Donald Trump, who could decide the issue one way or another with a
                        single tweet.</p>

                    <p data-elm-loc="9">One point worth bearing in mind is that the agency has been reviewing the
                        performance of the 737 Max 8 for almost five months since the Lion Air crash, including the
                        behavior&nbsp;of the angle-of-attack sensors and Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System
                        that appear to have malfunctioned in that incident. That should lend weight to its confidence in
                        the plane’s continued airworthiness: It’s hard to believe&nbsp;the agency would now be&nbsp;backing
                        up the 737 Max’s performance&nbsp;if any scintilla of doubt remained.</p>
                    <p data-elm-loc="10">Even so, the FAA&nbsp;has in the past been accused of being too lenient.
                        Whistle-blowers in 2008 alleged the regulator looked the other way when Southwest Airlines Co.
                        neglected to inspect and maintain its&nbsp;planes properly.</p>
                    <p data-elm-loc="11">In the case of the 787 Dreamliner, which was grounded for 123 days in 2013
                        after fires broke out in its on-board lithium-ion battery packs, a review by the National
                        Transportation Safety Board found that the agency&nbsp;had lacked the technical expertise to
                        evaluate the safety of the new technologies used, and was too trusting about&nbsp;Boeing’s
                        assumptions. At the same time, others have argued the FAA overreached in that grounding order:
                        For all the angst at the time, the 787 has gone on to be a popular plane with an excellent
                        safety record.</p>

                    <p data-elm-loc="12">“It’s wrong to rush to judgment” in the 737 case, Kenneth Quinn, a partner at
                        Baker &amp; McKenzie LLP and former FAA chief counsel who acted for Boeing’s battery
                        manufacturer GS Yuasa Corp. in the Dreamliner case,&nbsp;said by phone Monday. “It’s a very
                        complex aircraft operated by human beings. Let’s let the facts be identified and analyzed, and
                        not let political or media pressure interfere with the process of the investigation.”</p>

                    <p data-elm-loc="14">That’s a worthy&nbsp;ambition, but with tens of thousands of people trusting
                        their lives to the 737 Max every day, it’s hardly surprising if passengers expect a more
                        proactive approach. The public at large accepts&nbsp;the inherently risky activity of flying
                        hunks of metal filled with kerosene and people over the world’s biggest cities. That acceptance
                        is dependent on the belief that airlines, manufacturers and regulators have zero tolerance for
                        risk. If it wants to maintain that faith, the FAA had better be confident in its judgment
                        call.</p>
